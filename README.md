# PlayProphet - First Iteration

This project is the first iteration of a sports betting simulation created to predict the winners and scores of games. It showcases the foundational work done in developing a basic model to simulate sports betting outcomes.

## Project Description

The initial version of this project aimed to:
- Develop a simple model to predict the winners of various sports games.
- Estimate the scores of the predicted games.
- Provide an easy-to-understand interface for displaying predictions and results.

## Current Status

This basic version of the sports betting simulation has been deprecated and is now displayed as a portfolio project to demonstrate the initial efforts and methodology. While it provides a glimpse into the foundational work, it lacks the advanced features and accuracy improvements currently being developed.

## Future Development

A more advanced version of this project is under development and will include:
- Improved prediction algorithms.
- Enhanced data analysis techniques.
- A more robust and user-friendly interface.

The new and improved version of the project will be hosted at: [www.playprophet.ai](http://www.playprophet.ai)

Stay tuned for updates and the official release of the advanced version!

Feel free to reach out and I will provide you with the URLs needed to run the deprecated code.

## Installation
